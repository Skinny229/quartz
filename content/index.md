title: Welcome to my personal wiki
---

This is a place for writing my thoughts and by conjuction a look into me. Taking inspiration from callan and ql. After looking at different engines this seemed liked the best compromise from wikijs and docuwiki. I don't need any features that wikijs features (and therfore need a postgres server???!!!)

Best part is probably the ability to be able to complile this to be servable behind a CDN. Thank you AWS for your free tier.
